Problem J1: Which Alien?

Canada Cosmos Control has received a report of another incident. They believe that an alien
has illegally entered our space. A person who witnessed the appearance of the alien has come
forward to describe the aliens appearance. It is your role within the CCC to determine which
alien has arrived. There are only 3 alien species that we are aware of, described below:
* TroyMartian, who has at least 3 antenna and at most 4 eyes;
* VladSaturnian, who has at most 6 antenna and at least 2 eyes;
* GraemeMercurian, who has at most 2 antenna and at most 3 eyes.

Input Format
The user will be prompted to enter two numbers. First, the user will be prompted to enter
the number of antenna that the witness claimed to have seen on the alien. Second, the user
will be prompted to enter the number of eyes seen on the alien.

Output Format
The output will be the list of aliens who match the possible description given by the witness.
If no aliens match the description, there is no output.
