Problem J1: Quadrant Selection

A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in.
There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below.

For example, the point A, which is at coordinates (12, 5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its x
and y values are positive, and point B lies in quadrant 2 since its x value is negative and its
y value is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither
of the two coordinates will be 0.

Input Format
The first line of input contains the integer x (1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000; x 6= 0). The second line of
input contains the integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000; y 6= 0).

Output Format
Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4) for the point (x, y).
